## Project Overview

Sentiment Analysis for Customer Reviews is a natural language processing (NLP) project designed to analyze and classify the sentiment expressed in textual customer reviews. The primary goal is to determine whether a given review is positive, negative, or neutral. This project utilizes machine learning techniques and models to automate the sentiment classification process.

The project comprises three main stages: data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. In the data preprocessing stage, raw customer reviews are processed to extract relevant features and prepare the data for training. The model training stage involves utilizing machine learning algorithms to train a sentiment classification model based on labeled datasets. Finally, the evaluation stage assesses the model's performance using various metrics.
